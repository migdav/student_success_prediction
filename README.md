# student_success_prediction
This paper explores studentâ€™s daily activity in a virtual learning environment in the anonymized Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). We show that the daily activity of students can be used to predict their success, i.e. whether they pass or fail a course, with high accuracy. This is important since daily activity can be easily obtained and anonymized. To support this, we show that the binary information whether a student was active on a given day has similar predictive power as a combination of the exact number of clicks on the given day and sensitive private data like gender, disability, and highest educational level. We further show that the anonymized activity data can be used to group students
